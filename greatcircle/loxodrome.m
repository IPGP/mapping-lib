function [lat,lon,dist,bear]=loxodrome(varargin)
%LOXODROME Rhumb line path and distance.
%
%	[LAT,LON]=LOXODROME(LAT1,LON1,LAT2,LON2) computes the line between two 
%	points defined by their spherical coordinates latitude and longitude 
%	(in decimal degrees), crossing all meridians of longitude at the same 
%	angle, i.e. a path derived from an initial and constant bearing.
%	LAT and LON contain vectors of coordinates of the way points.
%
%	[LAT,LON,DISTANCE,BEARING]=LOXODROME(...) returns also vector of
%	distances (in km) along the path way, and constant bearing angle (in
%	degrees from North, a scalar).
%
%	[...]=LOXODROME(...,N) uses N intermediate points (default is 100).
%
%	Example:
%
%	  load topo
%	  contour(0:359,-89:90,topo,[0,0],'k')
%	  [lat,lon,dis,bear] = loxodrome(48.8,2.3,35.7,139.7);
%	  hold on, plot(lon,lat,'r','linewidth',2), hold off
%	  title(sprintf('Paris to Tokyo = %g km - bear = %g N',dis(end),bear))
